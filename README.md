### Description

The Replace-function in VB6 is an extremely useful in many occasions, but unfortunately, it is as most string-functions in VB rather slow. Therefore I&#8217;ve tried to optimize this operation, and I must say the result is satisfying &#8211; it is nearly 50 times faster replacing 35.000 characters than the native Replace-function.

The code should also work in VB5, where the native function doesn&#8217;t even exist.
 
### More Info
 
As Replace in VB6, only that "Start" is now defining the position within the expression where the substring search is to begin.

The string replaced.
